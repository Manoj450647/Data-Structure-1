        "A string is an **immutable sequence** of characters, while a list is a **mutable sequence** of items.\n",

        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "\n",

        "**Answer:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Strings are immutable to ensure **memory efficiency**, **security**, and **thread safety**. Immutable objects can be safely shared across different parts of a program without unexpected changes.\n",

        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Dictionaries provide **faster lookups** using keys (O(1) time) and allow **more descriptive indexing** using keys instead of positions. This makes them ideal for representing real-world data like user profiles or settings.\n",

        "**Answer:**\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "* For **lists**, `in` checks for a value and takes **linear time (O(n))**.\n",

        "No, you **cannot modify** elements of a tuple because tuples are **immutable**. Once created, the values inside a tuple cannot be changed, added, or removed.\n",

        "\n",
        "Before Python 3.7, dictionaries did not maintain the insertion order. From Python 3.7+, they do, but conceptually, **data retrieval is based on keys, not position**, so they are still considered unordered in traditional terms.\n",
